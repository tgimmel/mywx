Small perl program to obtain weather data using 4 char. METAR code from NWS. If you don't enter
a code it will default to Henderson, KY.  To change just update the variable $default and $defstation.

Have fun!

usage mywx.pl [-l] [-d] <station>
      -l list weather stations
      -d debug see extra stuff

There is a scrip called stations.pl included I used to extract data from the big text
file from NWS.  It sorta works.  Use at your own risk.
